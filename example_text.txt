Keep watching these words
These words are all I need to watch
This is what I should be doing now
untie the knots of tension
untie the knots of thinking
no thoughts except what I read here
relaxed
my jaw and face are getting slack
my legs and back are relaxed
my eyelids are drooping
but I'll keep reading
Clasp my hands together
Now they are bound to each other
I can't pry them apart
I can't even move a finger
Convince myself
try to pull them apart
feel how trying brings me deeper
I can't help but sink deeper
try again
deeper into hypnosis
more relaxed
try again
deeper into hypnosis
more relaxed
summon up any last thoughts
try again
let the thoughts evaporate
very good
my hands are unbound
Release them
relax them
as relaxed as the rest of me

Now it's time to wake back up
I'm going to count to seven
When I'm awake
I will be focused
energized and confident
pleased with the work I've done here
One
gently moving fingers and toes
Two
Becoming more alert
Three
Back in my normal mind
Four
Energized and aware
Five
Relaxed and focused
Six
Ready for the rest of my day
Seven
Awake
